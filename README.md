## 🔧 Setup Options

You can set up the Low-Code Assistant in three ways: local setup, Docker, or Kubernetes.

### Option 1: Local Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/low-code-assistant.git
cd low-code-assistant
```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```env
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Application Settings
APP_ENV=development
```

Alternatively, you can add your API key through the application's User Account Setup section when you run the app.

#### 5. Run the Application

```bash
# Run the simplified version (recommended for first-time users)
streamlit run simple_app.py

# Or run the full application
streamlit run llm_coding_assistant.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser to access the application.

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

For a containerized setup, you can use Docker:

#### 1. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t low-code-assistant:latest .
```

#### 2. Run the Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --name low-code-assistant low-code-assistant:latest
```

#### 3. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

#### 4. Stop and Remove the Container

```bash
docker stop low-code-assistant
docker rm low-code-assistant
```

### Option 3: Kubernetes Deployment

For production-grade deployment, use our Kubernetes configuration:

#### 1. Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (local like Minikube or remote)
- kubectl installed and configured
- Docker registry access (for storing images)

#### 2. Using the Deployment Script

We provide a deployment script (`deploy.sh`) that simplifies the Kubernetes deployment process:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Full deployment (build, push, deploy)
./deploy.sh --registry your-registry.com --tag v1.0.0 all

# Or run individual steps:
./deploy.sh build     # Only build the image
./deploy.sh push      # Only push to registry
./deploy.sh deploy    # Only deploy to Kubernetes
```

#### 3. Manual Kubernetes Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

```bash
# Apply namespace first
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml

# Apply other resources
kubectl apply -f k8s/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/secret.yaml   # Create this file with your secrets
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
```

#### 4. Accessing the Application

The application will be available at the host configured in your ingress resource (default: `https://low-code-assistant.example.com`).

You may need to update your DNS or hosts file to point to your cluster's ingress controller IP.

**Key Components & Highlights:**

* **Model Integration:** Either embed a smaller code-focused model locally or leverage an API for code completions.
* **Fine-Tuning:** Train/fine-tune on publicly available GitHub repos to specialize in certain languages or frameworks.
* **Live Editor:** Provide a browser-based editor with real-time suggestions.
* **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Fully containerized with Docker and production-ready Kubernetes manifests for scalable, resilient deployment.

## 🔄 Making Changes & Pushing to GitHub

### Important Considerations

1. **Database Security**: 
   - The database with user credentials is stored in the `data/` directory
   - This directory is already added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally pushing user data
   - Make sure to never commit the `data/users.db` file to your repository

2. **API Keys**: 
   - Never commit API keys to GitHub
   - Keep the `.env` file in `.gitignore`
   - For Kubernetes deployments, use secrets for storing API keys

### Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

```bash
# Initialize Git repository (if not cloned)
git init

# Add all files (the .gitignore will exclude sensitive files)
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit of Low-Code Assistant"

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/low-code-assistant.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Contributing Guidelines

When making changes to the Low-Code Assistant:

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow the code style of the project
   - Add tests if possible
   - Update documentation accordingly

3. **Test your changes**:
   - Run the application locally and test all affected features
   - For authentication changes, ensure user data is handled securely

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: detailed description of changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a pull request
   - Describe your changes in detail
   - Mention any issues that your PR addresses

### Important: Protect Your API Key

Make sure your `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent your API key from being pushed to GitHub:

```bash
# Create or edit .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to protect API keys"
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: If you get errors about the API key, check that it's correctly set in `.env` or in the UI
- **Model Not Found**: If you get a "model not found" error, try selecting a different model from the dropdown
- **Dependency Errors**: If you have issues with dependencies, try updating pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- **Connectivity Issues**: Make sure you have an internet connection to access the OpenAI API
- **Docker Issues**: If the container fails to start, check logs with `docker logs low-code-assistant`
- **Kubernetes Issues**: Verify pod status with `kubectl get pods -n low-code-assistant` and check logs with `kubectl logs -n low-code-assistant <pod-name>`
- **Health Check Failures**: The application uses the path `/_stcore/health` for health checks. If probes are failing, check if this endpoint is accessible
